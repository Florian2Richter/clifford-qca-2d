# Clifford QCA 2D

A Python implementation of a 2D Clifford Quantum Cellular Automaton simulation with a Streamlit UI.

## Description

This project simulates a 2D Clifford Quantum Cellular Automaton (QCA) on a grid. The simulation:
- Uses Pauli operators (I, X, Z, Y) to represent quantum states
- Implements periodic boundary conditions
- Provides visualization of the evolution over time
- Includes a Streamlit-based user interface

## Features

- 2D grid-based QCA simulation
- Visualization of Pauli operator evolution
- Interactive Streamlit UI
- Support for different grid sizes and time steps

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
